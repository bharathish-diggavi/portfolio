A backend-focused software engineer with over nine years of professional experience, 
primarily working with Java and the Spring ecosystem. I enjoy building reliable, s
calable systems and have worked extensively on designing and developing APIs, microservices, 
and backend platforms.

Beyond my professional work, I have a strong interest in learning how systems work 
end to end. I enjoy experimenting with self-hosted services, home lab setups, and tooling 
that improves developer productivity and I enjoy writing about them.
